So basically what I have set up is a ngrok tunnel which you have to also run in another 
terminally while running your stream lit application


To run the streamlit application

Run in the 1st terminal
    "streamlit run main.py --server.port 8502"
    
Run these two commands in a second terminal 

    "ngrok config add-authtoken 2ddSFTL73SePeg8xxIY1FX2fttD_5Y9VBvaxzFD8dhCT3hfHk"
    
    "ngrok http 8502"
    
    "ngrok config add-authtoken 2f0bmkKtdTU3HSeoE4abbA8SJIJ_3BdWSWyyjsrxneZtofrRr"   - Main-copy.py




In future you can sign up and make an account in ngrok but for now you can use my auth token.
