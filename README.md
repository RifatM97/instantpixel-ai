Marketing teams globally spend a significant amount of time and resources creating social media campaign posters, often with limited creative resources and uncertain success. Existing AI image generation models lack the ability to leverage brand-specific assets and require a significant gap between user intent and the final image.

Develop an AI-powered platform that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision to streamline social media campaign poster creation for marketing teams. This platform will:
Understand user intent through text prompts and marketing goals.
Integrate seamlessly with existing brand assets library (icons, pictures, etc.).
Generate creative and on-brand social media poster designs based on user input and brand guidelines.
Offer customizable design elements like color palettes and layouts.
Reduce design and production time for social media campaigns by X%.
